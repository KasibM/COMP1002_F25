                        When <a href = "https://jamesbond.fandom.com/wiki/James_Bond_Wiki">James Bond</a> is dispatched to Instanbul to pick up a top-secret coding machine from the Russians, he falls for the considerable charms of Tatiana Romanova, a Soviet cipher clerk. Believing that she is working for her government, Tatiana is actually a pawn of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPECTRE"><span class = spectre>Spectre</span></a>, the international crime syndicate. If everything goes according to plan, she will lure the British agent to his death (in the words of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Stavro_Blofeld">Blofeld</a>, 'a particularily unpleasant and humiliating one')... The second James Bond film, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Russia_with_Love_(film)" ><em>From Russia With Love</em></a> bears little resemblance to the big-budget, fast paced 007 escapades we are familiar with today. While there is the requisite complement of guns, gadgets, girls and gags, they are of a very moderate variety. The guns are largely of the hand-held variety (although some <span class = spectre>Spectre</span> agents sport grenade-launching cannonry), the gadgets quantly uncomplicated (a tape recorder hidden inside a box camera) and the gags elementary (after shooting down a helicopter, Bond quips, 'I'd say one of their aircraft is missing'). In spite of this, the film is replete with classic moments: the prolonged flight on a train between Bond and the Red Grant (Robert Shaw with peroxide hair), the onslaught of the East German operative Rosa Klebb (with her venom-tipped boots) and the gypsy cat-fight between Martine Beswick and Aliza Gur. More importantly, the film is strong on story, suspense and throwaway humour. But it is Sean Connery as Bond, an object lesson in <em>sang-froid</em>,who makes the whole package so immensely watchable
