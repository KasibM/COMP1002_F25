                        When James Bond is dispatched to Instanbul to pick up a top-secret coding machine from the Russians, he falls for the considerable charms of Tatiana Romanova, a Soviet cipher clerk. Believing that she is working for her government, Tatiana is actually a pawn of <span class = spectre>Spectre</span>, the international crime syndicate. If everything goes according to plan, she will lure the Britich agent to his death (in the words of Blofeld, 'a particularily unpleasant and humiliating one')... The second James Bond film, <em>From Russia With Love</em> bears little resemblance to the big-budget, fast paced 007 escapades we are familiar with today. While there is the requisite complement of guns, gadgets, girls and gags, they are of a very moderate variety. The guns are largely of the hand-held variety (although some <span class = spectre>Spectre</span> agents sport grenade-launching cannonry), the gadgets quantly uncomplicated (a tape recorder hidden inside a box camera) and the gags elementary (after shooting down a helicopter, Bond quips, 'I'd say one of their aircraft is missing'). In spite of this, the film is replete with classic moments: the prolonged flight on a train between Bond and the Red Grant (Robert Shaw with peroxide hair), the onslaught of the East German operative Rosa Klebb (with her venom-tipped boots) and the gypsy cat-fight between Martine Beswick and Aliza Gur. More importantly, the film is strong on story, suspense and throwaway humour. But it is Sean Connery as Bond, an object lesson in <em>sang-froid</em>,who makes the whole package so immensely watchable
